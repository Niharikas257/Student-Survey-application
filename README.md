# Student-Survey-application
A microservices-based student survey application.
A cloud-native, microservices-based application for managing and analyzing student survey data. Built with Spring Boot, containerized using Docker, and deployed on AWS EC2 via a Kubernetes cluster managed with Rancher. CI/CD automation implemented using Jenkins.

# Features

- Microservices architecture with modular Spring Boot services
- Docker-based containerization for isolated service deployment
- Kubernetes-based orchestration using Rancher
- Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) via Jenkins
- Scalable cloud deployment on AWS EC2 with Elastic IP and custom AMIs

# Tech Stack

- Backend: Java, Spring Boot (Microservices)
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes (Rancher UI)
- Cloud Platform: AWS EC2, AWS AMI, Elastic IP
- CI/CD: Jenkins (build, test, deploy pipeline)

# Deployment Architecture

Spring Boot Microservices
↳ Docker Containers
↳ Deployed on Kubernetes Cluster (Rancher)
↳ Hosted on AWS EC2
↳ Managed via Jenkins CI/CD

# Outcome

1. Reduced deployment time by 40% through containerization and CI/CD automation
2. Achieved modularity, reusability, and cloud portability using Docker and Kubernetes
3. Delivered a scalable, resilient student survey system for academic feedback collection
